## Card game

Goal: Create a card game in Android.

Last weekend, for your homework you were asked to create a card game using objects modelled in Java. You are now being asked to take that Java code and use it as the basis for an Android app which plays the same game of cards.

HINT Think of the lessons where we wrote regular Java classes in Android Studio, ran unit tests on them, and then used them in our Eight Ball app.

MVP

The game does not need to have much or any interaction. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic already written. For example, if you had two players being dealt two cards each your screen might look something like:

  Player 1: Ace of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds
  Player 2: 3 of Clubs, 2 of Hearts

  Player 1 Wins!

Project Extensions

Possibly add another card game
Improve the UI

## To run:

Open in Android studio and emulate. Have fun and let me know about your longest game of War! :)
